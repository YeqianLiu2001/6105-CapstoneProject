Technical Approach:

To tackle this challenge, I am developing a predictive model using Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), a type of recurrent neural network that is well-suited to modeling time-series data. This choice underscores the complexity of the problem due to the sequential nature of traffic data and its non-linear patterns.

From an Employer’s Perspective:

The evaluation of this project is being conducted from an employer’s perspective, focusing on three main aspects:

Depth: The project goes beyond surface-level analysis, delving deep into advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models to handle the intricacies of time-series forecasting.
Use Case: It directly addresses a practical problem—optimizing law enforcement patrols—which has significant implications for cost savings, efficiency improvements, and public safety.
Complexity: The project handles multiple layers of complexity, from preprocessing large datasets to selecting and tuning a sophisticated LSTM model that predicts traffic patterns.
Conclusion:

This capartment project aims to not only showcase my technical skills but also my ability to apply these skills to complex, real-world problems. The insights generated by this project could help streamline operations and strategy in traffic management and law enforcement, demonstrating the tangible benefits of data science in public sector applications.
